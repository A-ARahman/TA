# Smart-Target
Smart Target is an IoT Systems that has Smart punching bag with data visualization tool for tracking and analyzing performance metrics for Martial Athletes, providing insights into power, mass, and speed dynamics over time. It features a comprehensive dashboard that displays the latest, highest, and average metrics across sessions. In Smart Target, we used Load Cell and Time of Flight Sensor for measurement. For calculation we use the following formula:

**Power (W) = mass (kg) * velocity (m/s)**

Where:
- **Power (W)** is the power in watts.
- **mass (kg)** is the impact mass in kilograms.
- **velocity (m/s)** is the impact velocity in meters per second.
